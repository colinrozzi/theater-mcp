# Theater MCP Server Adoption Plan

## Background

We've successfully created a refactored implementation of the Theater MCP Server that directly utilizes the Theater project's types, providing better type safety and avoiding duplication. However, to minimize disruption, we've kept both implementations and are currently using the original one.

## Adoption Plan

### Phase 1: Testing and Verification (Current)

1. **Parallel Implementations**: Keep both implementations available but only use the original ones.
2. **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests that verify both implementations produce the same results.
3. **Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that exercise the key functionality.
4. **Documentation**: Document the new implementation and the transition plan.

### Phase 2: Gradual Transition

1. **Transition client.rs to client_new.rs**:
   - Create a feature flag `use_theater_types` that switches between implementations.
   - When the flag is on, use the new implementation; otherwise, use the original.

2. **Transition resources**:
   - Update the resources module to use the new implementations when the feature flag is enabled.
   - Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining the same interface.

3. **Transition tools**:
   - Update the tools module to use the new implementations when the feature flag is enabled.
   - Create wrappers if necessary to ensure the same behavior.

### Phase 3: Full Adoption

1. **Enable by Default**: Change the feature flag to be enabled by default.
2. **Deprecation Warnings**: Add deprecation warnings to the original implementations.
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update the documentation to reference the new implementations.
4. **Migration Guide**: Create a migration guide for users of the library.

### Phase 4: Cleanup

1. **Remove Feature Flag**: Remove the feature flag and always use the new implementations.
2. **Remove Old Implementations**: Delete the original implementations.
3. **Code Cleanup**: Clean up any remaining references to the old implementations.

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Type Safety**: By using Theater's types directly, we ensure that all operations are type-safe.
2. **Consistency**: Changes to Theater's types will automatically be reflected in the MCP server.
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to keep the two projects in sync as Theater evolves.
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminates duplicate type definitions and conversion code.
5. **Better Error Handling**: More specific error types and better pattern matching.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Testing and Verification)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Gradual Transition)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Full Adoption)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Cleanup)**: 1 week

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1 Tasks

1. [ ] Create unit tests for client.rs and client_new.rs
2. [ ] Create unit tests for resources implementations
3. [ ] Create unit tests for tools implementations
4. [ ] Create integration tests for common user scenarios
5. [ ] Document the new implementation approach

### Phase 2 Tasks

1. [ ] Add feature flag `use_theater_types` to Cargo.toml
2. [ ] Update theater module to conditionally export implementations
3. [ ] Update resources module to conditionally use implementations
4. [ ] Update tools module to conditionally use implementations
5. [ ] Test with feature flag both enabled and disabled

### Phase 3 Tasks

1. [ ] Enable feature flag by default
2. [ ] Add deprecation attributes to original implementations
3. [ ] Update documentation to reference new implementations
4. [ ] Create migration guide for library users
5. [ ] Run full test suite with new implementations

### Phase 4 Tasks

1. [ ] Remove feature flag and conditional compilation
2. [ ] Delete original implementation files
3. [ ] Clean up any remaining references
4. [ ] Final testing and documentation pass

## Challenges and Mitigations

### Potential Challenges

1. **Breaking Changes**: The new implementation might have subtle behavior differences.
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and gradual adoption with feature flags.

2. **API Evolution**: Theater's API might evolve, requiring updates to our implementation.
   - *Mitigation*: Regular syncing with Theater project and CI tests.

3. **Performance Differences**: The new implementation might have different performance characteristics.
   - *Mitigation*: Add performance benchmarks to identify any significant changes.

4. **Client Compatibility**: External clients might depend on specific behaviors.
   - *Mitigation*: Maintain backward compatibility and provide clear migration guides.

## Conclusion

This adoption plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from our current implementation to one that directly uses Theater types. By taking a gradual approach with proper testing and verification at each step, we can minimize disruption while gaining the benefits of a more type-safe and maintainable implementation.
