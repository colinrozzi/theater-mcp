# Theater MCP Server Connection Resilience Implementation

This folder contains the implementation of the Theater connection resilience enhancement as described in the change request.

## Overview

The implementation adds automatic reconnection capabilities to the Theater client, making the MCP server more resilient when the Theater server connection is dropped. Key features include:

1. Automatic reconnection when operations fail due to connection issues
2. Periodic heartbeat to detect stale connections
3. Improved error handling and reporting
4. Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

## Changes Made

1. **TheaterClient**:
   - Changed the connection field to hold an Option<TcpStream> instead of a direct TcpStream
   - Added connection state tracking
   - Implemented the ensure_connected() method to validate and restore connections
   - Enhanced the send_command() method with retry logic and connection error handling
   - Added a heartbeat mechanism

2. **Server**:
   - Added heartbeat initialization
   - Implemented proper cleanup of the heartbeat task

3. **Tools and Resources**:
   - Added connection error handling to all Theater client calls
   - Improved error messages to indicate reconnection attempts

## Testing

To test the reconnection mechanism, you can use the provided test script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x changes/test_reconnection.sh

# Run the test
./changes/test_reconnection.sh
```

The test script will:
1. Start the Theater server
2. Start the MCP server
3. Test initial connectivity
4. Simulate a Theater server crash
5. Restart the Theater server
6. Test reconnection

## Implementation Notes

- The reconnection mechanism uses exponential backoff with a maximum of 3 retry attempts
- The heartbeat checks connection health every 30 seconds
- Only one thread will attempt reconnection at a time (using atomic flags)
- Detailed logging indicates connection issues and reconnection attempts
